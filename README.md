Challenges and Resolutions
After completing the internship, I encountered unexpected billing charges due to active Bedrock, KMS, and Agent services. With guidance from Amit Arora and AWS Support, I resolved these issues by terminating the active services and ensuring no further charges. This process concluded successfully on July 15th, thanks to the support and assistance from AWS and Amit Arora.
